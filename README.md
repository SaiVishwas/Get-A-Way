# Get_A_Way

This was a project done as a part of the Software Engineering course (13CS354) during the 6th semester of BE in CSE . 

  Our project aims at providing a user-friendly interface to avail these amenities from the sellers nearest to the user, 
while on a tour. We also aim at enriching the userâ€™s experience by suggesting nearby places of attraction. Our main focus is 
on tourism in Karnataka. Our project also aims at providing the following features:

  1. Optimal path - If the user/tourist is interested in visiting a set of places (say a, b, c), we try to provide them with an
  optimal way of travelling through a, b and c. Once a path has been obtained, we try to provide the user with an approximate
  time it would take and the travelling expenses for the same.

  2. Suggestions - Provide a list of nearby places the tourist might be interested in visiting besides the chosen points of 
  interest.

  3. Facilities en route to the destination - Create an interface to access nearby hotels, restaurants, malls, hospitals and 
  other basic amenities en route to the destination.

  4. Tourism Chatbot - A Chatbot interface to make queries about Karnataka Tourism in a more user friendly manner.
